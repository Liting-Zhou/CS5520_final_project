#### App Introduction:

The name of our application is **Currency Companion**, which is designed to do effortless currency conversion, stay updated with the latest currency exchange rates, keep track of your financial assets, find the nearby currency exchange organizations, save currency exchange history and set notifications on exchange rate changes.

#### Target Users:

Currency Companion is designed for all adults who need to convert currencies and find nearby exchange organizations. It's especially ideal for those interested in forex trading and those who regularly engage in personal asset management.

#### Test Scenarios:

**Scenario I:** As an anonymous user, one can customize a list of live exchange rates, convert currencies, and manage financial assets, but can only save the data after login. In this scenario, the user goes through these three main functions of the application.  
**Scenario II:** As a login user ... 三个主要功能和匿名用户一致，除了他可以 save customized data。所以这里可以测一下 profile 这块，就是 sketch 的后面四张图。一个建议哈～
