#### App introduction:

The name of our application is **Currency Manager**, which is designed to do effortless currency conversion, stay updated with the latest currency exchange rates, keep track of your currencies, find the nearby currency exchange organizations, save currency exchange history and set notifications on exchange rate changes.

#### Target users:

Currency Manager is designed for all adults who need to convert currencies and find nearby exchange organizations. It's especially ideal for those interested in forex trading and those who regularly engage in currency management.

#### Test scenarios:
